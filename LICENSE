mouse.js:

/* Collect entropy from mouse motion and key press events
 * Note that this is coded to work with either DOM2 or Internet Explorer
 * style events.
 * We don't use every successive mouse movement event.
 * Instead, we use some bits from random() to determine how many
 * subsequent mouse movements we ignore before capturing the next one.
 * rc4 is used as a mixing function for the captured mouse events.
 *
 * mouse motion event code originally from John Walker
 * key press timing code thanks to Nigel Johnstone
